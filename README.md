This repository provides two scripts to download `main.go` and `main_test.go` files for lessons in a Go course. One script (`console.js`) allows you to download files for a specific lesson by pasting a URL in the console, and the other (`script.js`) downloads files for all lessons by reading data from a `data.json` file.

#### How to use:
1. Open the browserâ€™s developer tools and go to the console.
2. Run the console.js in the console.
3. This will trigger the download of the lesson's `main.go` and `main_test.go` files.
- This script is best for downloading files for a **single lesson** when you know the URL of that lesson.

#### How to use:
1. Ensure you have a `data.json` file with the structure similar to the provided example.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install node-fetch
   ```
3. Run the script using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```

4. This will automatically create directories for each chapter and lesson and download the `main.go` and `main_test.go` files for every lesson in the course.

## File Structure

Here is a sample file structure generated by the `script.js`:

```
/Ch 1 Variables/
    /Learn Go (for Developers)/  
        main.go
        main_test.go
    /Basic Variables/
        main.go
        main_test.go
    /Short Variable Declaration/
        main.go
        main_test.go
/Ch 2 Data Types/
/Ch 3 Functions/
